# C# .Net Software Development Kit for the older legacy version of the Saasu API
This repository is a version of the Saasu software development kit in the C# .Net language, for working with the older legacy version of the Saasu API. This version of the Saasu API is not being actively enhanced (apart from bug fixes) and will eventually e phased out over a period of time.

For help on the API itself, you can look at the [help documentation](http://help.saasu.com/api/)
